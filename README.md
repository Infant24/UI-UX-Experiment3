## Aim:

To Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

## Algorithm:

UX Evaluation and Redesign of Zomato vs. Swiggy


1. Introduction
This case study analyzes the usability and user experience of two leading food delivery apps, Zomato and Swiggy, using Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics. The objective is to identify UX issues in Zomato, propose improvements, and test their effectiveness through A/B testing.

2. Heuristic Evaluation Summary
Heuristic	Swiggy	Zomato	Key Issues in Zomato
Visibility of system status	✅	⚠️	Order status lacks clarity
Consistency and standards	✅	⚠️	Inconsistent button design
Error prevention	✅	❌	No filter undo
Recognition over recall	✅	⚠️	Requires too much input
Aesthetic and minimalist design	✅	⚠️	Crowded UI


3. Suggestions for Zomato's design
A. Change how order tracking works
Add clear steps for delivery, like "Getting ready," "Out for delivery," and "Delivered."

Animate the ETA and add a delivery worker icon.

B. Consistency of Buttons
Make sure that all of your screens' buttons are the same size, color, and style.

C. Clear and Undo for Filters
Put in a button that says "clear filters" or "undo last action."

D. Searching with your voice
Use voice search to cut down on typing errors.

E. Visual Simplification
Reduce item density per screen.

Use icons with text to help recognition.

4. A/B Testing Plan
Aspect	Control (A)	Variant (B)
		
Order Tracking	Existing UI	Redesigned UI
Filter Controls	No undo	Undo button
Search	Manual typing	Voice-enabled
Layout	Crowded	Cleaned, more whitespace

5. Metrics for Evaluation
•	Order Completion Rate
•	Task Time (Time to Order)
•	Support Queries (related to tracking)
•	Retention (7-day return)
•	Voice Feature Usage




6. Results (Simulated Example)

Metric	A (Control)	B (Variant)

	Result
Completion Rate	62%	75%	✅ +21%
Avg. Time to Order	5.2 min	3.6 min	✅ Faster
Support Queries	83/week	51/week	✅ -39%
Voice Usage	0%	34% adoption	✅ Successful

7. Conclusion
The redesigned features significantly improved usability and engagement on Zomato. A production rollout of the improved features is recommended based on successful A/B testing.
